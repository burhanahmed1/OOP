# OOP with C++

Task1: Write the following code and observe the output.

Task2 : Given two integers x and y, find and print their sum using pointers.

Task3 : Write a C++ program that creates a pointer to an integer and print the following: Square of the integer, cube of the integer, half of the integer.

Task4 : Write a C++ program that finds and prints the median of following three integers using their pointers.

Task5 : A C++ program where you create an integer array of size 10. Your program will add 3 to each element of the array.You have to add to the elements using pointer only.Array subscript notation cannot be used(neither in addition nor while printing resultant array).

Task6 : Write a program that keeps taking integer input from the user until user enters -1 and displays the data in reverse order.

Task7:
  Q # 1:-
  Take two arrays of integers A and B of sizes M and N respectively (M and N taken from User).Then you need to mix these arrays into a third array named C such that the followingsequence is followed.
  All even numbers of A from left to right are copied into C from left to right.
  All odd numbers of A from left to right are copied into C from right to left.
  All even numbers of B from left to right are copied into C from left to right.
  All old numbers of B from left to right are copied into C from right to left.
  
  Q # 2:-
  Write a program that keeps taking integer input from the user until user enters - 1 and displays
  the data in reverse order.
  Your program should save the input in a dynamically allocated array.Initially create a dynamic array of five integers.Each time the array gets filled your program should  double the size of array(i.e., create a new   
  array of double size, copy previous data in new array, delete previous array) and continue taking the input.After receiving - 1 (i.e., end of data input) your program should print the numbers in the reverse order as 
  entered by the user.
  
  Q # 3:-
  Take size input from the user and create an array of that size.Now populate the array as well
  by taking input from the user.
  • First Implement void copyArray(int* arr, int*& amp; arr1, int size) that copies arr into arr1.
  • Now implement another function int reduceArray(int* arr, int*& amp; arr1, int size) that
    asks user to enter size to reduce the array.To reduce the array remove the elements of the arr
    from the start and copy remaining into arr1.Use copyArray function to copy.
